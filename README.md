# Slider Puzzle

Welcome to the **Slider-Puzzle**! This is a classic sliding puzzle where the goal is to arrange numbered tiles in order from 1 to 15, with an empty space at the end. You can also switch to a mode where the puzzle consists of an image instead of numbers, and both modes are synced with one another. Keep track of your progress with the built-in move counter!

## Features

- **Numbered Tiles Mode**: Arrange tiles numbered 1-15 in the correct order, with the empty space in the bottom-right corner.
- **Image Mode**: Switch to solve a picture puzzle, synced with the numbered mode.
- **Move Counter**: Keep track of how many moves you've made.
- **Tile Movement**: Click on any number adjacent to the empty space to swap positions. Movement is restricted to up, down, left, and right.

## How to Play

1. Start by arranging the numbers from 1 to 15 or solving the image puzzle.
2. Click on any number adjacent to the blank space to slide it.
3. You can move tiles in four directions: up, down, left, or right.
4. Switch between **Number Mode** and **Image Mode** at any time, and your progress will be synced between the two.
5. The move counter will show how many moves you've made to reach the solution.
